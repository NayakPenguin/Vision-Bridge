## Features

<b>1. Currency Detection Model:</b> Our simulator allows users to present images of Indian currency notes to the camera. Through Densenet and some extra dropout and densely connected layers the model is trained. Then the models weights are used in a flask api which is deployed in aws ec2 instance.The system learns to identify the denomination of the money, providing users with a seamless experience to determine the amount accurately.

<b>2. Road Safty Model:</b> Our simulator allows user to know which type of car is infront of him. We trained a model of car classification model .... (details of model) .... which is deployed and used in reactjs by tensorflowJs.
